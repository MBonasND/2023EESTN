Supplemental Codes for "High Resolution Urban Air Quality Monitoring from Citizen Science Data with Ensemble Echo-State Transformer Networks" by Matthew Bonas and Stefano Castruccio

## Data
Simulated data "LorenzData" with 40 variables (locations) and 1000 time points. This data is to be used in conjunction with the associated R and Python scripts to produce forecasts with the DESN and TNN models referenced in the manuscript.

## Code
R and Python scripts to produce forecasts on the simulated data for the DESN and TNN models. User should run the R script to produce forecasts for the DESN and to generate the data to to be used as input for the TNN.
